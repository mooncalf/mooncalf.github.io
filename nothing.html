<h1>Worse Than Nothing</h1>

<!-- <blockquote style="font-variant: small-caps"">
  <p><i>More distressing even than silence—an incomprehensible message.</i></p>
</blockquote> -->

<p>Greg slides out of his truck onto legs unsteady after a long, unbroken drive. The air is warm and thick, fetid, like
  the breath of a heavy, monstrous animal. The taste of it is sickeningly intimate and immediately brings back a hundred
  unwelcome memories.</p>

<p>Hank sits waiting outside his cabin in an old green-backed, rusty metal wheelchair, his grizzled face an exaggerated
  hang-dog. He raises a slow hand in greeting as if to do more would take more life than he has left in him.</p>

<p>“What’s with the chair?” Greg asks him without preamble, playing his part with the confidence of lifelong practice.
  Hank doesn’t hesitate to take the cue, telling his nephew of his latest calamity, suddenly vigorous.</p>

<p>“Fell on my goddamned face!” he explains. “Eight stitches,” he adds, pointing to a chin so thick with tangled gray
  beard that any evidence to his claim is hopelessly buried. But Greg has no doubts.</p>

<p>“Were you drunk?” Greg asks.</p>

<p>“Yeah I was fuckin’ drunk!” Hank retorts, as if there could be no stupider question.</p>

<p>Greg asks him how an injury on his chin necessitates being chair-bound.</p>

<p>Hank insists that being on his feet is risky. His doctor has told him to stop drinking, but Hank knows it’s not the
  drunkenness but the sobering up that’s more dangerous. He tells his nephew in dramatic tones about the lead singer of
  his favorite metal band, how he was fine until he quit the booze, then got sick and was dead within a month. Alcohol
  may be bad, sure enough, but sobering up is worse, Hank’s decided. Greg thinks that, in his own case, he may be right.
  Better on the bottle.</p>

<p>“My body’s just used to the sauce now, doesn’t know what to do without it…” So to be on the safe side he keeps his
  drunk ass in the chair, at all times a bottle of whisky sloshing in his lap.</p>

<p>Greetings now observed, Hank gets down to business. “You gotta go take care of them cats. And Reba!” he commands. He
  rolls after Greg with great effort over the uneven ground toward his cabin. “She must be half starved. That dog and
  those cats are the only thing he ever gave a shit about. I can’t believe he just up and left them alone like that.”
  Greg wonders if he’s only imagining a hint of pain in his uncle’s voice, that he might include himself in the list of
  those abandoned.</p>

<p>“Almost seems inconsiderate, doesn’t it?” Greg says.</p>

<p>Hank gives his nephew wary side-eye, suspicious of mockery but too drunk to be sure, or care much. </p>

<p>“Still just you up here?” Greg asks him, looking out at the forest as if he might spot some sign of others he’d
  missed on the way in. An excuse to look away from what has become of his uncle.</p>

<p>“Yup. And those goddamn hillbillies, of course.”</p>

<p>This is Hank’s sarcastic name for the family that has lived above the compound on the Mountain since long before
  Greg’s dad bought the land. Literal centuries, maybe. His dad never asked them to leave or to pay a penny in rent. To
  Hank’s chagrin.</p>

<p>“They’re still around?”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah, squattin’ up there somewhere. I guess I could get rid of them now that the place is mine. But it just ain’t
  worth the trouble. Anyway, I know your dad would want them to stay. God fuckin’ knows why.”</p>

<p>Greg has no doubt there’s more to it than that—Hank wanting people around up here, even if he rarely sees them and
  considers them somewhat less than human. What else to gnash his few remaining teeth at?</p>

<p>He remembers the little girl, a sad slip of a thing. She’d be a grown woman now. Probably never left the Mountain
  more than a day in her life. He winces at the thought.</p>

<p>She used to come down from her parents’ shack and visit the old man. For some reason. Desperate for company, Greg
  supposes. She was odd. Barely spoke. Didn’t need to, really, as his dad was happy to fill in all the gaps in
  conversation. He would let loose thoughtful monologues at the tiny creature as if he had no idea the girl was unlikely
  to comprehend a word of it. Say the kinds of personal things one would reserve for a confidante, a brother-in-arms, a
  shrink. Greg found it tasteless and a bit obscene, but that was Dad—no sense of boundaries. Of course, the kid never
  seemed to mind.</p>

<p>Now she has a kid of her own, one even more odd, claims Hank. </p>

<p>“He’s come down here snootin’ around a few times since your dad’s been gone. I run him off. Never says a word, just
  gawks at you with them big eyes. Gives me the fuckin’ willies. He used to sit up there when your dad was workin’ on
  his truck, sit there and listen to all your dad’s b.s., just the way his mama did when she was little. Mountain people
  are a weird fuckin’ bunch. I guess them two is the last, though. I don’t suppose the world’s gonna miss them much.”
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When he gets up to his father’s cabin Greg finds the cats screaming hungry and he pours piles of food in the floor
  for them which they attack in a frenzy, fighting with each other over it despite there being plenty. But no sign of
  his father’s big greyhound. He calls her from the front porch. Nothing. All the better, he thinks. What to do with all
  these fucking cats, though?</p>

<p>The older cats won’t come up on the tables and countertops, no matter how he coaxes them, but the young ones quickly
  learn that nothing is now off-limits. Despite their recent near starvation they are all too fat and he makes promises
  to get them fit, but will soon fall into a routine of feeding them whenever they ask.</p>

<p>He spies a kid’s toy sitting on a table by the front door, inexplicable, at odds with all the rest of the junk. A
  plaything amidst the trappings of a practical and joyless life that has long forgotten play. A little plastic
  superhero set carefully on its feet, one fist raised as if in salute, posed. Was it there before the old man did
  himself in? Had his dad left it as a farewell? The neighbor’s kid, as an offering? The old man would never tell, and
  the kid wouldn’t either. A secret between them forever.<br /></p>

<p>He looks around his father’s tiny cabin. Very little sign of the old man here, despite living here almost fifty
  years. His father couldn&#39;t be bothered to take care of himself, didn’t care to invest much in his own comfort. Not
  selfless, Greg knows, just believing that taking care of things was someone else&#39;s job. His wife’s. After she died
  and there wasn&#39;t anyone to do it, all fell into disrepair, an entire life neglected. </p>

<p>Everyone thought his father was such a tough guy. But Greg knows that, in truth, he feigned toughness out of a
  powerful vanity that was the only impulse stronger in him than fear.</p>

<p>When his wife died he crumbled and his vanity crumbled with him. Fear became his only drive and he hid up here on the
  Mountain for the rest of his days with no-one but his son and brother as witness. He batted around the compound, a
  rudderless derelict, hopelessly adrift, slowly going under.<br /></p>

<p>The first night he’s here, Greg stands out on the front porch smoking a cigarette he found rolling around in his
  father’s desk drawer, the last of its kind. He hasn’t smoked in years and the unfiltered tobacco makes him dizzy. He
  gazes into the darkness between the trees, feeling momentarily sentimental despite his efforts. How ignorant was he as
  a kid to see this desolate, neglected place as magical? Dim memories creep up on him, distant feelings of the woods as
  endless and full of mystery, before he got old enough to realize just how close was the highway with its trash and
  roar and stink. With its certain, sad destinations.<br /></p>

<p>He lives off the odds and ends left in his father’s pantry and freezer for as long as they last. Frozen boxes of
  various animal bits, “best by” dates long past. </p>

<p>Every morning he is up before the sun, wrapped in his sleeping bag at the dingy little desk, checking his bank
  account on an ancient laptop he thinks he probably couldn’t lift with one hand.</p>

<p>Still nothing. He snaps the laptop shut and the room falls back into darkness, the morning light gray and reluctant.
  He’ll have to ask Hank for help. He stomps his socked feet against the hard wooden floor in frustration. A satisfying
  boom. He hears a rustle somewhere above him. Rats? A bird, maybe. He sits in silence for a moment, listening, but
  hears only the early morning sounds of the forest outside.</p>

<p>He feels raw. His stomach churns and aches like he has a hangover, despite incurring no debt the night before. He’s
  up too early, but the thought of crawling back into his father’s creaky, lumpy, musty bed repels him. He nods off a
  few times sitting at the desk before forcing himself up and into the claustrophobic shower.<br /></p>

<p>Greg eyes the bathroom door before going in. That’s where his father died, hanging against that thing, he knows. He
  was found with a belt thrown over the top and the door closed to hold it, the other end buckled around his neck. He
  got drunk enough first that he wouldn’t be able to change his mind at the last moment. Just in case. If he did
  struggle at the end there’s no sign of it now. Just a door, a simple machine his father put to sinister use. He tries
  not to imagine it. Could have been worse, Greg supposes. But he hesitates a moment before grabbing the knob and going
  in, as if the door might still hold some hint of the deed. He feels nothing but the cold metal of the knob in his
  hand.<br /></p>

<p>Greg had a friend whose kid killed themselves while still a teenager, leaving behind a garbled note. Often when he
  spoke to his friend the conversation would turn to the short, scribbled letter, his friend obsessed with finding a
  secret message hidden in obvious nonsense. He would bash his head against this bloodied wall again and again, reading
  and rereading his kid’s pain-addled gibberish, searching for meaning coded in screeching static. An explanation. A
  reason. A farewell.</p>

<p>Greg’s father left nothing. Neither word nor sign. Greg feels grateful for this when he thinks of his friend’s vain
  and endless struggle.</p>

<p>More distressing even than silence—an incomprehensible message.<br /></p>

<p>Despite being shoddy and cheap, the shower is hot and strong and he drifts off again with its tiny fingers massaging
  his scalp, his back pressed against the flimsy metal of the shower wall. He half-dreams of all the cold and achy
  people of the world and wishes them each such a momentary reprieve. How hard-won such a minor thing can be, he thinks.
  Something that should be taken for granted.<br /></p>

<p>Out on the porch again, hair wet, blood warmed. He can see no further into the forest this morning than the night
  before, but the thick blanket of fog that clings to the trees glows bright white from the hidden morning sun. He feels
  some peace out here when all is quiet and hidden. He begins to make a habit of coming out to escape the oppressive
  early morning gloom of the little cabin.</p>

<p>At first these morning vigils are lonely affairs, but after a few days the cats grow accustomed enough to his
  presence that they begin to creep out on the porch with him, perching on the rail or in the chair next to his. They
  seem to desire his company even though they are yet unsure of his character. By the end of the week the largest tom
  cat has taken to curling up in his lap, on the condition that Greg not attempt to lay a finger on him. It purrs
  silently but he can feel it—a strong, deep rumble of contentment. Greg dozes with its warm weight on his legs. The
  sounds of the forest muffled by the heavy fog lull him, and he dreams of all the mornings his father sat here,
  watching the forest through half-lidded eyes, a cat in his lap. Nothing changes. Nothing stays the same.<br /></p>

<p>Digging through his father’s things, he finds a trunk shoved back in the closet, locked. He can’t quite bring himself
  to care enough to search too hard for a key, or try to break it open. Can’t be anything of any value in it anyway. His
  dad’s memorabilia. Bits of junk. He kicks it and thinks it sounds empty. Just like his dad to lock an empty chest, he
  tells himself, and then wonders what he means by it. He eventually decides to forget about it. There will be many
  things he’ll have to leave alone, things forgotten, questions unanswered, mysteries unsolved. The old trunk is just
  another of these.<br /></p>

<p>Days pass in isolation, just him and the cats and the droning of the forest around them, pierced at times by the
  sound of Hank’s frenetic music from down the Mountain. Greg begins to feel as if he’s waiting for something, but can’t
  decide what it might be. </p>

<p>Mysterious signs appear everywhere. A mark rather like a handprint in the rime on a window. Something random missing
  from his nightstand. Strange sounds like someone weeping. One dim, misty morning, he thinks he sees shadows moving
  between the trees but doubts his vision. The Mountain is playing tricks on him.</p>

<p>Then, three visits in as many days.<br /></p>

<p>The first is Reba, his dad’s missing greyhound. He spots her through the window one afternoon, sneaking up onto the
  porch, nose to the ground. Searching for a hint of where her old man has gone. She flees as Greg opens the door to
  approach her, and joins a motley crew of other dogs loitering in the trees nearby, a feral pack that wanders the woods
  of the mountainside. Some abandoned, some marooned. A few escapees. </p>

<p>She watches him, a wild gray spirit between the dark trees, her long neck and ears craned toward him, curious,
  perhaps a glimmer of recognition in her pale eyes. He calls to her and she hesitates a moment longer than the others
  before turning away. He does not see her again.<br /></p>

<p>Early the next day while he is nodding off at his father’s desk, he is visited by another silent phantom. Leaning
  back in the little wooden chair, both it and his back creaking in complaint, he suddenly realizes a tiny white face is
  hovering in the darkness beside him. He is so startled that he nearly tumbles over backward before catching and
  righting himself.</p>

<p>The neighbor’s kid. It makes no sound and does not react to Greg’s display of surprise. After the initial shock at
  this appearance wears off and the pounding of his heart ebbs some, Greg regards his visitor and is immediately put in
  mind of the wan, emaciated children who lurk beneath the cloak of Dickens’ Ghost of Christmas Present.
  <em>Ignorance</em> and <em>Want</em>. This kid could be either, Greg thinks. Perhaps both. </p>

<p>The longer he tries to communicate with it the more disturbed he becomes by the little creature’s unsettling silence.
  Eventually, chafed at having to stoop to Hank’s level as he sees it, Greg shoos the kid away like a stray animal. It
  turns and departs slowly, its movements oddly languid for a child. It grabs the little toy figure off the table beside
  the door as it goes, and Greg gets the uncomfortable feeling that the kid has more right to be here than he does
  himself. Strange, but less of a stranger.<br /></p>

<p>The day after, the kid returns, this time towed behind its mother. She has the air of someone on a mission, Greg
  thinks with a frown.</p>

<p>At the door, Greg searches her face for signs of the little girl she had been but sees not a glimmer. She looks like
  any other adult now. Tired, spent.</p>

<p>“I was real sorry to hear about your daddy,” she says, stepping past him into the cabin, “he was a good man.”</p>

<p>Greg nods silently, the only answer he can muster at the moment.</p>

<p>“Do you know why he done it?” She asks, wanting to understand, an imploring look in her eyes. As if Greg is any more
  likely to be privy to such knowledge than she.</p>

<p>“Sick of living, I guess,” Greg tells her bluntly.</p>

<p>She nods as if this explains everything. As if she understands. Perhaps she does.</p>

<p>“I ain’t been sleeping,” she tells Greg, seemingly apropos of nothing. </p>

<p>After a moment of awkward silence she adds “Your daddy was real good about helping me out.” Her voice is weak,
  hesitant. A pleading edge.</p>

<p>“Helping you out?” Greg asks.</p>

<p>“With medicine,” she explains.</p>

<p><em>Of course.</em></p>

<p>Without another word, he goes into the bathroom and opens the medicine cabinet behind the mirror where he finds a
  prescription bottle of pain medication. He grabs it and gives it a shake. Half full, about. </p>

<p>As he turns to leave the bathroom he stumbles over the kid who’s appeared behind him, something shiny in its grubby
  little hand. Greg sees it’s his dad’s straight razor and quickly snatches it away.</p>

<p>“Not a toy,” he says, tossing the razor into the sink with a clatter.</p>

<p>He takes the bottle to the woman and when she sees it her eyes light up like a cat spotting a mouse.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much!” she says, snatching the bottle from him.</p>

<p>She stops herself as she turns to go.</p>

<p>“I sure will miss him.”</p>

<p>Greg nods in acknowledgment more than agreement. As she leaves she grabs the kid by the arm and drags it after her
  when it shows no sign of following on its own.</p>

<p>Greg can see she’s eager to get the pills down. Maybe with a vodka chaser. </p>

<p><em>Sweet dreams.</em><br /></p>

<p>The kid is back by sunset that night, alone. Its arms and face are smeared with something that looks black in the
  half light but red when Greg looks more closely. Blood gone tacky, a few hours old. Too much for a bloody nose. Greg
  looks the kid over but sees no wounds. </p>

<p>“Are you hurt? Whose blood is this?” Greg asks it, but gets the answer he expects—the kid stares at him silently.
</p>

<p>“Where’s your mama? Is she hurt?” </p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Greg sighs heavily. “Show me where your house is,” Greg tells the kid, more annoyed than concerned. He imagines the
  woman fallen in a drugged-up stupor, her head split open on a hard kitchen floor or upon cement steps to a back yard.
</p>

<p>It’s a lot of blood.</p>

<p>Greg pulls a hoodie over his head, feeling a momentary sting of shame as the kid’s in a ragged t-shirt and shorts,
  its feet bare, though it doesn’t seem to mind the chill.</p>

<p>“Show me your house,” Greg repeats his command to the child. He pushes it toward the door when it shows no sign of
  moving. It plods off at a medium pace, heading down the porch stairs and out into the woods. Greg follows.</p>

<p>A path takes them between the trees, higher up the Mountain, and ends in a small, shabby shack. The windows are dark,
  no sign of lights within, though the sun is down now and dim evening has claimed the woods around it. </p>

<p>The kid walks straight up to the front and goes in, letting the ragged screen door swing shut behind him. Greg
  catches it before it slams and follows the kid into the cramped little house. </p>

<p>“Hello there!” Greg calls out, but the house is as silent as his guide.</p>

<p>The kid goes down a little hallway and through a doorway at the end. Greg steels himself as he enters after it, half
  expecting the woman to be sprawled on the floor somewhere in a pool of blood. </p>

<p>The woman lies in bed, atop the bedspread, dressed in the same clothes she wore when he saw her. Her skin is so pale
  it seems to shine in the darkness, the shadows around her eyes so deep he can’t tell if they are open or shut but he
  feels as if she’s staring across the room at him.</p>

<p>The kid takes something off the nightstand next to the bed and then crawls into bed next to her, curling up against
  her. The woman is utterly still. </p>

<p>One of her arms and the side of the bed are streaked and stained dark.</p>

<p>Greg creeps toward the bed and looks more closely, hesitant, like he fears a wild animal there, ready to strike. Her
  arm is slashed to ribbons. Maybe a dozen deep cuts. Maybe more. The bottle of pain pills is on the nightstand next to
  her, beside a nearly empty bottle of whiskey. The bed clothes appear soaked with blood.</p>

<p>At first he thinks she’s taken his father’s example and done herself in. Her hands are empty, but he sees the kid’s
  are not. In one hand it holds what looks like his father’s straight razor. He can see its glint in the darkness. The
  kid must have snatched it again after Greg took it away. A terrible thought strikes him.</p>

<p>“Did you do this?” he asks the kid, the cold grip of shock closing around him.</p>

<p>The kid holds the blade up to Greg as if showing him a new toy, dark eyes fixed on the gleaming, bloody blade. </p>

<p>Greg studies the woman’s face. She does not look like she’s sleeping. She looks like a lifeless thing. “She’s fucking
  dead,” Greg tells the kid, surprised by the flat, expressionless tone of his own voice.</p>

<p>As he stands frozen, staring at the dead woman, the kid reaches up and opens her cheek up with the razor in one
  stroke, like drawing a line with a pencil on smooth paper. The skin pulls back to reveal the woman’s teeth in a grisly
  lopsided grin. The kid turns back toward Greg and holds the blade up to him again, sharing a new discovery, its eyes
  still locked on the blade in apparent fascination.</p>

<p>Greg quickly steps toward the bed and reaches out to take the razor from the kid, terror at the thought of witnessing
  further mutilation breaking through his shock. The kid cuts Greg’s hand in a single, swift motion, laying the skin of
  his palm open in a wide gash. Greg hisses in pain and surprise, snatches his wounded hand back, staring in momentary
  disbelief at the cut. Slowly it begins to dribble blood and Greg grasps it with his other hand, looking up at the kid,
  transfixed.</p>

<p>“You little fucking bastard,” he says in a voice still oddly emotionless, as if the kid’s strange apathy has infected
  him.</p>

<p>Moments pass as the blood from Greg’s hand begins to run down the front of him, soaking his shirt and coating his
  other hand in slippery gore.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on some silent cue, Greg turns and strides from the room, down the hall, out the door, and back down the
  path, walking swiftly and clutching his hand, which has begun to burn like it’s gripping hot coals.<br /></p>

<p>He heads back to his father’s cabin in the dark, holding his bleeding hand against his chest, nearly losing his way
  several times, stumbling often on the uneven path.</p>

<p>When he finally finds his way back he wraps a torn shirt around the wound and stands in the middle of the room for
  several minutes before a resolve like panic suddenly seizes him, another silent cue, and he begins throwing his meager
  belongings into his backpack, mindlessly piling it all in and heading for the door like a man threatened by fire.</p>

<p>At the last moment he drops his pack, grabs the heavy bag of cat food and up-ends it onto the floor, scattering its
  remaining contents with a clatter. He grabs his pack again and pushes his way out the door.</p>

<p>As he heads for the truck his eyes search the darkness in horrified shame, but there is no sign of witness. He throws
  his loaded backpack into the back and hops in, starts the engine, and tears out of the compound going too fast,
  fighting the urge to floor the gas and race down the dark, narrow road.</p>

<p>He figures the woman’s body could lie up there undiscovered for a very long time. Years, maybe. He imagines the kid
  going feral, growing up wild and living off the land while its mother’s body rots in bed. Or maybe it’ll just curl up
  next to her and wither away.</p>

<p>He follows the winding road back down the mountainside. As the distance between him and the top of the Mountain
  grows, a powerful feeling of relief grows with it. As if distance is enough.</p>

<p>It is not until he’s almost reached the foot of the Mountain that he remembers he has nowhere to go.</p>
