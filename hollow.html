<h3>Hollow Victory</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One can be virtuous through a whim.” —Albert Camus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“‘Prepare to die, fool!’ he said!” </p>

<p>Star Girl gasps, her luminescent eyes wide with shock at the audacity of the insult. “He called you a …
  ‘<em>fool</em>’?” </p>

<p>Nick nods silently, noble bearer of indignities.</p>

<p>But just then, Nick tells his avid little audience, as he and the villainous Empyrean Emperor of the Galaxy are about
  to cross swords, Sky City was suddenly rocked by a devastating attack from the Vulture Men who were seeking to send
  the city down into the Vortex, and Emperor Ro’Burda with it. So determined were they to destroy their foe that their
  concern for the fate of their great ally, Captain Nick Swift, trapped with the Emperor on Sky City, was forgotten.</p>

<p>As the first volley of attacks struck their mark and weakened the massive stabilizers that kept Sky City afloat above
  the void, the entire structure rumbled and shook amid a series of deafening explosions. Both Nick and the Emperor were
  thrown violently off their feet and sent tumbling to the ground. As this first wave passed, Nick leaped back up in a
  flash, but Emperor Ro’Burda, becoming entangled in his long Imperial robes, struggled for a moment to regain his feet.
  Nick did not hesitate. With the speed and agility of a jungle cat, he dashed across the still precariously tilting
  floor and, without pause, ran the evil Empyrean Emperor through the heart with his golden blade.</p>

<p>“The Emperor looked up at me in horror and defeat!” the Captain tells the friends and crew-mates who surround him,
  rapt and adoring. “Before he could gasp his last breath, I looked right into his eyes and said ‘That’s what you get
  for wearing a dress to a sword fight… <em>fool</em>!’”</p>

<p>This elicits the expected howls of delight, and Nick makes no attempt at hiding his pleasure, basking in the
  adoration of his crew-mates.</p>

<p>Star Girl’s shining, meta-plasma eyes glow more brightly and her pudenda swell and moisten as she gazes at Captain
  Swift with boundless and lustful admiration. </p>

<p>Caliban the apeman pounds his chest and lets loose a roar that would chill the blood of strangers and foes. A thick
  and musky stench pervades the cockpit of the tiny rocket as he releases a heavy cloud of celebratory flatulence. </p>

<p>Even Rex-Star the space-dog barks and spins in circles, overcome with astro-canine jubilation.</p>

<p>Only Professor Yarikovskayavovich appears unmoved, but this is due to the fact that the Professor has recently
  transferred his consciousness into a robotic body to prolong his life after receiving a fatal dose of radiation during
  their recent adventure. Professor Y, as he is affectionately (and practically) called by his crew-mates, had made the
  questionable decision to remove the skin from the face of his human body and affix it to the front of his new robotic
  head. This was intended to “enhance the relatability” of his new form, as well as “preserve some of his humanity”, as
  he had put it. None of the crew has the heart to tell the Professor that the effect is rather the opposite. Rex-Star
  the space-dog, in fact, is the only member of the crew that has expressed appreciation for the Professor’s “enhanced”
  appearance, although the Professor seems to interpret Rex-Star’s behavior toward him as affectionate when it is
  clearly of a more gustatory nature.</p>

<p>In any case, the Professor’s new face is incapable of adequately expressing the joy that would, no doubt, be
  overwhelming his fusion-powered heart if it were capable of any emotion whatsoever. A verbal congratulations must
  suffice.</p>

<p>“Brilliantly done, Captain! Quite the <em>coup de grâce</em>! To both the Emperor and his entire nefarious Empire!
  All forces remaining loyal to the Emperor are fleeing. You have liberated the outer worlds and saved our Earth from
  certain destruction!”</p>

<p>Cheers erupt in the little cabin while the Captain stands, hands on hips, a winsome smile dawning like a glorious
  sunrise over the cleft horizon of the manliest chin in the galaxy.</p>

<p>For the next several hours, the crew celebrate their victory, reminiscing about their most recent exploits, rejoicing
  in often violent, sometimes ribald, tales of a little ragtag band of Earthlings who brought bloody humiliation and
  crushing defeat to a self-proclaimed “superior” alien species.</p>

<p>“It almost makes me feel sorry for them,” Star Girl reflects, a look of nearly-sincere sympathy in the cosmic sparkle
  of her star-filled eyes.</p>

<p>Nick responds with an utterly pitiless grin, though nodding in agreement. “So much for the ‘apex of human
  evolution’!” he snorts, using the Emperor’s own oft-repeated, self-adoring description of the “Empyrean” race.</p>

<p>“Worry not, my dear!” Professor Y reassures Star Girl. “The Empyreans are rather unusual creatures. Unlike other
  intelligent beings, they are quite incapable of feeling pain!”</p>

<p>“I think you may be mistaken, doc!” Nick turns to the Professor with a bemused chuckle. “I’ve heard more than a few
  cries and wails of agony from those spineless rascals. I lost count of how many times I had to listen to them beg for
  mercy! Pathetic!” </p>

<p>Caliban backs this claim up with enthusiastic grunts and guffaws. “Wimpy aliens!” the apeman growls. Nick and Caliban
  share a hearty laugh, which the professor, eager as ever to instruct and share his knowledge, is quick to interrupt.
</p>

<p>“Actually, despite their behavior, Empyreans are not properly conscious,” says the professor very matter-of-factly.
  “In their efforts to engineer themselves into super-human beings, in their experiments to make themselves stronger and
  more resilient, they long ago inadvertently erased their own sentience.”</p>

<p>“What’s this?” Nick’s full attention is suddenly brought to the discussion, a deep furrow creasing his noble brow.
</p>

<p>“Yes,” the Professor clarifies, “the Empyrean race is bereft of true inner experience. While their race has succeeded
  in millennia of epic interplanetary campaigns, of cultural and scientific progress, within them there is nothing but
  emptiness and silence! Ironic isn’t it? In truth, they suffered nothing at our hands, for they are, in fact, incapable
  of suffering at all!”</p>

<p>Nick suddenly finds the professor’s perfunctory tone grating, and can hardly believe his ears. He finds himself
  seized with the inexplicable urge to smash a fist into the side of the professor’s metal bucket of a head. </p>

<p>“Hold on a minute there, professor! How could that be possible?” A shadow creeps across the Captain’s heroic
  features, his joyful and triumphant grin turning downward in a grimace of vexation and dismay.</p>

<p>At that moment, Rex-Star decides to take advantage of the humans’ obvious distraction and make a play at getting a
  morsel off the professor’s face. Nick notes with some disgust that the patch of skin has become ragged from the
  space-dog’s previous attempts.</p>

<p>“Not now, boy,” Professor Y gently scolds Rex-Star as the dog begins to lick and nibble at the leathery sheet bolted
  onto his gigantic metal head. Nick can hardly blame the space-dog … the skin looks rather like very dry jerked
  chicken. Nick suddenly realizes that he has not eaten in several hours and is quite hungry himself. But that can wait.
  Something much more distressing than a grumbling belly nags at him now.</p>

<p>“Are you telling me that the look of utter pants-shitting terror that Emperor Ro’Burda gave me when I ran my sword
  through him was … <em>fake</em>?”</p>

<p>“I mean to tell you that the Emperor was incapable of terror, or sensation of any kind. All of the Empyrean race are
  and have been for centuries. Whether he shat his pants or not I cannot say.”</p>

<p>Nick suddenly appears deep in thought. Highly unusual.</p>

<p>“What is it, Captain? What is troubling you, my friend?” the professor asks, synthesizing an optimal level of
  concern.</p>

<p>But Nick cannot answer. Three years of triumphant carnage have been brought suddenly to naught, a terrible truth
  dropped upon him in a single ponderous blow. He is staggered by the impact, and rendered speechless.</p>

<p>Star Girl notices the Captain’s distress. Unlike the Professor, who perhaps does not fully grasp the joy of
  vanquishing one’s foes, Star Girl feels she understands what has made the Captain so glum.</p>

<p>“But … if they are alive, surely they must suffer!” she offers.</p>

<p>“Is a tree not alive?” the Professor responds, enthusiastically taking up this philosophical debate. “And yet we have
  no reason to believe that it suffers pain when its branches are cleft. To be living is not necessarily to be
  conscious! A flower is alive, and yet has no brain with which to experience the trauma of being plucked,” Professor Y
  explains with grand gesticulations of his clumsy mechanical hands.</p>

<p>“You mean Empyreans don’t have <em>brains</em>?” Star Girl asks in wonderment.</p>

<p>At this, Nick emerges from his dejected stupor. “Well, I know they have brains,” he says with a snort, “because I’ve
  gotten more than a few of them on my boots!” Caliban grunts in confirmation of this.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, yes, they do have brains, of course,” Professor Y responds, “but their brains are simply machines,
  driving their bodies and behaviors without inherent emotional experience.”</p>

<p>“But if they have brains, they must think! And if they think, they must have feelings, right?” Star Girl reasons, a
  quizzical look on her perfectly symmetrical features.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily … not all thought is feeling,” Professor Y points out. “While the particulars are not entirely
  understood by Earthly scientists, some theories suggest the facility of ‘embodiment’—the connection of the mind to the
  body—is necessary for true consciousness. It is this element, ‘the ghost in the machine’ as it were, that the
  Empyreans lack.”</p>

<p>A microsecond after it is emitted from his speech synthesizer, the professor regrets using this analogy. He finds
  that his enjoyment of this intellectual exchange is beginning to wane somewhat. </p>

<p>“So … they have no <em>soul</em>, then,” Star Girl concludes.</p>

<p>Professor Y starts to protest this idea, and the idea of the existence of the “soul” in general, but then considers
  that, perhaps, this is the best explanation available … under the circumstances. </p>

<p>“Well … I suppose one could say that they are soulless creatures, yes,” he says.</p>

<p>“So this would explain why they are so evil!” she proposes.</p>

<p>“Ah … perhaps. In a manner of speaking,” the Professor says flatly.</p>

<p>“Hmph … fuck ‘em then,” Star Girl resigns.</p>

<p>“So,” Nick mutters, “fighting an Empyrean is like … battling a tree.”</p>

<p>“An <em>evil</em> tree,” Star Girl points out. </p>

<p>With this, Professor Y’s central processing unit becomes somewhat overwhelmed and he finds he can do nothing but
  resort to repetition. The strongly emotional responses from his crew-mates have caught him off guard. “In a manner of
  speaking,” he says again, his voice sounding oddly blunted.</p>

<p>“Glorious,” Nick grumbles. “So much for justice!”</p>

<p>“Well… I suppose it depends on the particular <em>conception</em> of justice,” Professor Y offers.</p>

<p>Nick gives the Professor a wide-eyed, incredulous stare. “‘Justice’ … you know … <em>making the bad guys pay</em>!”
  he says, clearly taken aback by the suggestion that there is any other reasonable definition.</p>

<p>Sensing the Captain’s increasing despair, Caliban the apeman attempts, for a moment, to follow this strange
  conversation, his mighty canines bared in confusion and discomfort, but he quickly allows his thoughts to drift back
  to simpler matters.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, that is certainly … an element of justice,” the professor haltingly replies, momentarily distracted by
  the apeman’s attempts at fishing a bit of dried mucus out of one of his monstrous nostrils. “And it would be missing
  in this case, wouldn’t it? How … unfortunate! Perhaps we should focus on the positive consequences of our victory!”
</p>

<p>“<em>Positive</em> consequences?” Nick repeats, his face twisted in bafflement.</p>

<p>Professor Y gets the feeling that this conversation is not going well. “Yes! For example the salvation of the human
  race! Or the return of the abducted Queen Mimi to the Jovians,” Professor Y searches his memory for examples that may
  allay the Captain’s distress. “And what about the liberation of the Snail People of Callisto?” He says with
  enthusiastic attenuation. The professor recalls how Nick beamed at the celebration on the desert moon as the Snail
  People threw off the bonds of a hundred years of servitude to the Emperor, thanks to the team’s heroic efforts.</p>

<p>Nick looks at him as if he’s gone mad. “Who gives a <em>rat butt</em> about <em>snail people</em>!?”</p>

<p>At this, the professor is distracted for several hundred thousand cycles into a subroutine regarding the nature of
  justice and its relationship to the human ego. He finds that he is having some trouble reconciling the Captain’s
  current behavior with the information he has on him in his memory banks. Has something been left out of his code? He
  resolves to do a full self-diagnostic at the first opportunity. </p>

<p>A few seconds later, Professor Y has recovered and is able to vocalize again.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose this could make victory feel … somewhat hollow.” He notes that his own confusion seems apparent in
  his voice, despite his efforts to suppress it. “From a … visceral perspective,” he adds.</p>

<p>“Hollow,” Nick says in a tone that suggests this word is a reflection of the feeling in the deepest parts of his
  soul. “Hollow,” he repeats, slumping into the pilot’s seat behind him, a look on his face like that of a child who has
  just been told he will receive nothing for Christmas this year but a subscription to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.
</p>

<p>Professor Y is confounded by the severity of this reaction. He decides that perhaps the Captain needs a moment alone
  with his thoughts. No doubt their triumphant return to Earth and the praise and celebration that will come with it
  will be a reassurance to the Captain. “Ah … I will go radio Earth and make certain they are quite ready for our
  arrival. No doubt they have prepared for us a hero’s welcome!” </p>

<p>“Cameras!” gasps Star Girl, suddenly realizing she has preparations of her own to attend to.</p>

<p>But as the professor turns to the communications console to send a message to Earth Command, he sees that even the
  promise of public adulation has failed to restore the Captain’s good cheer. Puzzling indeed!</p>

<p>Left alone in the quiet cockpit as the others go about their various tasks in preparation for their arrival back on
  Earth, Nick finds his feelings of triumph at this victorious return have melted into an emptiness almost like sorrow.
</p>

<p>His thoughts drift wistfully back to his life before all this hero business, when he was just a simple man. Before
  being suddenly and very unexpectedly thrown into a cosmic battle for the salvation of the galaxy, he was a security
  guard for a department store. Humble but important work. It had brought him a great deal of satisfaction—stalking the
  aisles, his gaze bringing fear and dread to would-be shoplifters.</p>

<p>Nick fondly recalls a time when he caught a young thief red-handed: a shabby-looking kid, no more than fourteen or
  fifteen years old, trying to make off with a box of tampons stuffed under his shirt. Just a teenager and already
  starting a life of crime! Nick couldn’t believe the kid thought he could get away with it. He’d snuck up behind the
  boy and snatched him by the collar. The kid had screamed like a little girl, so terrified that his legs gave out under
  him. Nick literally had to drag him to his feet. </p>

<p><em>Tampons!</em> Nick thinks with a snort. <em>What kind of idiot steals</em> tampons<em>?</em></p>

<p>When Nick spun the kid around and the kid got a look at his towering, intimidating captor, decked out in a dark blue
  security uniform, he knew he was done for. Nick had never seen such fear. He chuckles at the memory. </p>

<p><em>Nothing fake about that!</em> he thinks with a wistful sigh.</p>

<p>Nick wonders what has become of his uniform. Carelessly tossed into a closet somewhere. He makes a plan to look for
  it when he gets home.</p>

<p>Just then, Star Girl enters the cockpit and finds Nick gazing out at the stars. She hears his heavy sighs and is
  certain he is reminiscing about their recent adventures, mourning lost comrades, struggling with the difficult choices
  that have been made. Rousing from his reverie, Nick notices her watching him and gives her a wink and a smile deeply
  tinged with melancholy. Star Girl has never wanted to fuck anyone so bad in her life.</p>
