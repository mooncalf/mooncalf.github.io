<p>All docs are marked <span style=“color:#800000”>BETA</span> or ALPHA</p>

<p>BETA docs I’ve edited somewhat, but not gotten feedback on.</p>

<p>ALPHA docs have just been hacked out, possibly as recently as the same day they are posted — expect major errors, etc.</p>

<h4>Beta Reader Checklist</h4>

<p>Here’s a short list of things you might want to keep in mind as you’re reading:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Does the story make you want to keep reading?</li>
	<li>Does anything not make sense, or not flow logically from what came before it?</li>
	<li>Are there any inconsistencies in the narrative (like someone firing a weapon that was supposed to be empty)?</li>
	<li>Is anything in the flow of the story jarring, or does anything seem missing or rushed?</li>
	<li>Is the action clear, and easy to picture as you’re were reading it?</li>
	<li>Do the characters behave in a consistent manner?</li>
	<li>Is there any part of the story you have to reread to understand what’s happening?</li>
</ol>

<p>Pointing out any spelling or grammatical errors you might find is of less concern, but would be appreciated.</p>

<p>If you’d like to come back here when you’re done reading and fill out the Beta Reader feedback form below, and/or join my weekly mailing list, please do.</p>

<h4>Alpha Reader Checklist</h4>

<p>Alpha docs will not have been edited before being posted here. I’m mostly just interested in feedback on the concepts and story. Here’s a short list of things you might want to consider while reading alphas:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Is the scene or exchange interesting?</li>
	<li>Is the scene something you’d like to see fleshed-out?</li>
	<li>If the scene includes characters you’re familiar with, do you feel their behavior is consistent with what you already know about them?</li>
</ol>
